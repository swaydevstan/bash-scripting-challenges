You work for Universe Incorporated. One of your users - `cloud_user` - has placed a ticket to have a script written to back up his `work` directory to a new directory named `work_backup` in his home directory. 

The script should also log all actions to a log file stored in the user's home directory.

Ensure the script works correctly by running it and verifying the files are backed up.
